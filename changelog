==============
version 1.1:
TASK: Option "use_datetime_filename_suffix" (datetimt in log-file names). In this mode log-files create new and remove old instead of replacing old file content.
    Task status: Applied, tested manually, there is not auto-tests.
TASK: Option "use_compression". In this mode log file size mean it's size before compression.
    So logging in this mode is caching. If Timeout elapsed then flush current logs. In futher this file must be rezipped with addon logs.
    Works only with "use_datetime_filename_suffix=true".
    Task status: Applied, tested manually, there is not auto-tests.
