==============
version 1.1:
TASK: Option "use_datetime_filename_suffix" (datetimt in log-file names). In this mode log-files create new and remove old instead of replacing old file content.
    Task status: Applied, tested manually, there is not auto-tests.
TASK: Option "use_compression". In this mode log file size mean it's size before compression.
    Current log file is normal, all previous files are compressed (using gzip)
    Works only with "use_datetime_filename_suffix=true".
    Task status: Applied, tested manually, there is not auto-tests.
